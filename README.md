## Topics Covered

### 1. Demand Analysis and Forecasting
- **Demand Classification**: Classify demand patterns to optimize supply chain processes.
- **Time Series Forecasting**:
  - ARIMA modeling
  - Linear regression for forecasting
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Explore relationships between multiple variables affecting demand.

### 2. Inventory Management
- **ABC Analysis**: Identify critical inventory items for prioritization.
- **EOQ (Economic Order Quantity)**: Optimize order quantities to minimize costs.
- **Safety Stock Policies**: Manage variability in demand with robust safety stock policies.
- **Critical Ratio Analysis**: Optimize inventory levels based on criticality and costs.
- **Simulation Models**: Evaluate inventory policies under uncertainty.

### 3. Pricing and Customer Segmentation
- **Price Response Functions**: Analyze how pricing changes impact demand.
- **RFM Analysis**: Segment customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.
- **Competitive Pricing**: Analyze multi-product competition to derive pricing strategies.

### 4. Data Analysis and Visualization
- **Excel Integration**: Use spreadsheets for initial data processing.
- **Data Cleaning**: Prepare raw data for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Present insights effectively using data visualization techniques.
